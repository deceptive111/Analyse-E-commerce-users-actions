Draft,

Aim, to classify 1000 users into several types to help business team to generate a selling tactic.
Methods:
this project has two stages,
Stage I is that we need to use RFM to evaluate the Value of the 1000 client.
Stage II is that we ought to classify them via some methods with the result of RFM.
A typical method for Stage II is K-means. However, it can be discussed.
We now should focus on the Stage I and build a good RFM model.
